I've published my first NPM package [js-import-sort](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-import-sort)!
Its a JS tool to sort and organise ES2015/ES6 imports. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Amwam/js-import-sort).

It was created using a tool from facebook called [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift), which is a library for building javascript codemods.



Example:

    import Main from 'aaaa';
    import {ZMain}  from 'aaaa';
       

    import First from 'zzz';
    import {Third} from 'zzz';
    

    import {Second} from 'zzz';
    

    import * as someDefault from 'bbb';
    

    import {a as b} from 'packageModule';
    

    import SomeClass from './MyModule';
    import AnotherClass from '../../Module1';
    

    import * as util from 'util';

Becomes:
 
    import * as util from 'util';

    import Main, {ZMain} from 'aaaa';
    import * as someDefault from 'bbb';
    import First, {Second, Third} from 'zzz';

    import {a as b} from 'packageModule';

    import AnotherClass from '../../Module1';
    import SomeClass from './MyModule';

Imports are separated by node, dependencies in `package.json`, other and relative imports.
