The [Mac Mini](./i-bought-a-mac-mini) arrived today!

Have only done some basic setup so far, mostly logging into accounts.

Jumped straight in today, and installed [TailScale](https://tailscale.com/), so now I can access the mac from anywhere, using a VPN. I can also use the mac as an exit node if I want.

Also setup a VNC, so I can use my iPad when away (and also connected via tailscale). Seems like one of the most recomended solutions was [Screens](https://edovia.com/en/screens/). Easy to setup and get started, and works quite well.

Only been able to use it on my local network so far, but performance seems pretty good.

Not a lot to share about the install experience yet, both these two applications didn't take up to get working.

Next thing I'll likely start looking at is Nix, to install packages, I'm currently writing this via the GitHub online editor.
