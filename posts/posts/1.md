Recently my current workplace has undertaken a branching strategy known as [**Branch Per Feature** by Adam Dymitruk](http://dymitruk.com/blog/2012/02/05/branch-per-feature/)

An overview
---

The core concept is that features of a project are independent, and can therefore be developed independently from one another. 
Each of these features have their own branch, cut from master, and are regularly integrated into a an 'integration' branch or '_develop_'
Once a feature is deemed to be complete, it is prepared for release by being merged into a 'release' branch. 
Once a release branch is published to production, it is then merged into master.

In order to make sure this process works across multiple features being developed at the same time, making use of git's 'rerere' (Replay Recorded Resolution) functionality.
This saves the resolutions of merge conflicts, which would be discovered when merging into the integration branch, and then reuses them when the same conflict is seen again.
