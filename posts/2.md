I've created a [Alfred] workflow to help search through jobs on a Jenkins CI instance.

It makes use of the standard Jenkins JSON API, and provides a way to fuzzy search through the job names, and view their current status.

![All jobs][alljobs]

Here is the view with all jobs being shown, the shortcut for this is `jenkins` (or `cmd`+`alt`+`ctrl`+`j`)

![Filtered jobs][filtered]

Simply start typing to filter down the list of jobs.



You can download the latest from either [Packal] or directly from [GitHub Releases].
