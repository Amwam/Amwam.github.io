I update my [Alfred] Jenkins workflow to 1.0.1 today ([Original post](http://amwam.me/blog/alfred-jenkins-workflow)).

It is just a minor release with a few bug fixes, and mainly a tidy up of the tests, making sure its up to 100% coverage. 
Also removed the mockito package, as there really was no need for it.



You can download it from either [Packal] or directly from [GitHub Releases].
