[Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) is a new project from Mozilla.
It aims to bring python into the browser, making use of WebAssembly. You can read the full blog post at [https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/04/pyodide-bringing-the-scientific-python-stack-to-the-browser/).

I wanted to try it out, and see how easy it would be run python in the browser, while also being able to interact with the DOM, as I would normally do in javascript. Turns out, Pyodide makes this really simeple. Pyodide will proxy javascript objects with their python counter parts, in a way that feels very seamless.

After I had got the project setup, I decided to have a go and running a small React application, written in Python.
As React isn't actually dependant on JSX syntax, this is trivial to get running thanks to Pyodide. All React components just have to return `React.createElement` calls instead (which babel would normally transalte JSX code into).

The result:

```python
from js import document, window

React = window.React
ReactDOM = window.ReactDOM


def HelloWorldReactComponent():
    return React.createElement(
        "div", {"style": {"display": "flex"}},
        "Hello world. This was rendered with React."
    )


ReactDOM.render(HelloWorldReactComponent(), document.querySelector("#result"))
```
