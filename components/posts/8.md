I've updated my [Alfred] workflow for searching through jobs on Jenkins. You can find it on [Packal] or on [GitHub Releases].

This release contains an update to the login flow to make use of the API token, allowing the workflow to work with any authentication strategy.

There is also now support for nested job structures (such as using the folders plugin)!
